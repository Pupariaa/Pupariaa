# Hi, I'm Pupariaa

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,nodejs,php,mysql,redis,express,html,css&perline=4)](https://skillicons.dev/)

Polyvalent developer for over 15 years, based in Haute-Savoie. I combine software development and electronics/hardware - because why choose when you can do everything?

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=arduino,raspberrypi,linux,docker&perline=2)](https://skillicons.dev/)

I started with HTML/CSS/PHP, but since then, I've evolved into a complete "maker" profile: from backend code to PCB design, through interface design and entrepreneurship.

I create tools for independents, usually solo, although sometimes I collaborate with my friends (notably [lakazatong](https://github.com/lakazatong) on some projects).

## My baby

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,nodejs,mysql,redis&perline=2)](https://skillicons.dev/)

**[Pupsbot](https://github.com/Pupariaa/pupsbot)** - My osu! bot that helps players find beatmaps suited to their level. Over 185 commits, used by thousands of players.

My story with osu! started in 2013. I reached global top 3000 in osu!mania, then migrated to the main mode. I created my first bot (Farbot) 4 years ago, but it was technically fragile. In January 2025, I started from scratch to create Pupsbot: stable, fast and modern.

osu! shaped my way of thinking and coding. This project is my way of giving back to a community that has given me so much.

## What I really master *(I hope so)*

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,nodejs,html,css,php,mysql,redis,express&perline=4)](https://skillicons.dev/)

**JavaScript/Node.js** - This is where I feel most comfortable. I love the flexibility and speed of development. Sometimes it works on the first try, sometimes not.

**HTML/CSS** - Solid foundations, even if CSS sometimes still makes me grind my teeth. Flexbox and Grid, my friends for life.

**PHP** - My starting point, still useful for certain projects. Yes, PHP is still alive in 2025, deal with it.

**MySQL** - SQL queries are like a puzzle I enjoy solving. JOIN, WHERE, and sometimes curses.

## What I know but don't really like *(or I hate it)*

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ts,vue,nextjs,c,cpp,cs,python,rust&perline=4)](https://skillicons.dev/)

**TypeScript** - I hate this, but it's mandatory to know at least a minimum. Strict typing gives me pimples.

**Vue.js** - Nice framework, lighter than React in my opinion. At least it's not Angular.

**Next.js** - For React projects, it's become my default choice. Sometimes overkill, but it works.

**C/C++/C#** - I rarely do it, except when I tinker with Arduino or other embedded projects. Memory management is not my thing.

**Python** - Perfect for scripts and automation. Mandatory indentation, but at least it's readable.

## My daily tools *(the ones that don't piss me off)*

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode,linux,docker,git&perline=2)](https://skillicons.dev/)

**Editors:** VSCode and Cursor *(because AI is the future, but not yet)*  
**OS:** Windows 10 LTSC *(because stability is important. And yes, I code on Windows)*  
**Testing:** Google Chrome and Polypane for responsive *(because testing on one browser is for amateurs)*  
**Infrastructure:** My own home server with multiple routers - I have perfect mastery of my network *(and yes, I have routers everywhere at home)*

### Hardware/Electronics *(where it gets interesting)*

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=arduino,raspberrypi,linux,docker&perline=2)](https://skillicons.dev/)

- **ESP32** - BLE, ESP-NOW, I²C, external EEPROM communication *(because WiFi isn't complicated enough)*
- **Arduino** - For embedded projects and rapid prototyping *(and making LEDs blink)*
- **Raspberry Pi** - Kiosks, monitoring, audio/video interfaces *(mini-computers everywhere)*
- **PCB** - Design on EasyEDA, manufacturing via JLCPCB *(because breadboard is for beginners)*
- **Engraving** - On glass and PCB for creative and technical aspects *(and because it's stylish)*

## My preferred stack *(the one that actually works)*

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nodejs,mysql,redis,express,nginx&perline=3)](https://skillicons.dev/)

**Node.js + MySQL + Redis + Express + Nginx**

This combination allows me to create fast APIs and web applications that hold up. Redis for caching *(because memory is expensive)*, MySQL for persistent data *(because NoSQL is good, but SQL is better)*, and Express to properly structure my routes *(or at least try)*.

## Where I'd like to evolve *(or I give up)*

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=mongodb,react,nextjs,redis,graphql&perline=3)](https://skillicons.dev/)

**Node.js + MongoDB + React/Next.js + Redis + GraphQL**

I want to switch to MongoDB for more flexibility in data structure *(because schemas are constraining)*, and deepen React/Next.js for the frontend *(because Vue.js is good, but React pays better)*. Redis stays in the equation, it's too practical to give up *(and GraphQL because REST is so 2020)*.

## My certifications *(yes, I have degrees)*

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=linux,docker,nginx&perline=1)](https://skillicons.dev/)

**TAI** (Technicien d'Assistance Informatique) - French state diploma Bac level, specialized in commissioning and troubleshooting digital equipment *(because not everyone can be self-taught)*.

**TSSR** (Technicien Supérieur Systèmes et Réseaux) - French state diploma Bac+2 level, focused on maintenance and operation of IT infrastructures *(and yes, I studied)*.

**Google FDM SEO Certification** - Specialization in search engine optimization *(because being visible is important)*.

**CCNA** (Cisco Certified Network Associate) - Recognized certification in computer networks *(and yes, I know how to configure routers)*.

**CIW JavaScript Specialist** - Certification attesting to advanced JavaScript skills *(because JavaScript isn't just tinkering)*.

## My other projects *(because Pupsbot isn't everything)*

### Software *(the clean side of code)*

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,nodejs,npm,git&perline=2)](https://skillicons.dev/)

- **[osu-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osu-utils)** - Tools to manipulate various aspects of the osu! game in Node.js *(because osu! isn't just playing)*
- **[cipherforge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cipherforge)** - Password generation and testing *(because "password123" isn't secure)*
- **[Composa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/composa)** - Complete library for sending emails via xHTML templates *(because emails aren't just text)*
- **SmartyHDD** - CLI disk utility with SMART PDF reports and printable labels *(because disks can fail)*

### Hardware/Electronics *(the dirty side of code)*

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=arduino,raspberrypi,linux,docker&perline=2)](https://skillicons.dev/)

- **LumiRail** - ESP32 master/slave system to control LEDs with visual timeline editor *(because LEDs are stylish)*
- **Multimedia kiosks** - Raspberry Pi for Spotify, YouTube, local audio *(because music is important)*
- **Custom PCBs** - Design on EasyEDA, engraving on glass and PCB *(because breadboard is for beginners)*
- **ESP32 projects** - BLE, ESP-NOW, LED drivers, scalable architectures *(because WiFi isn't complicated enough)*

### Collaborations *(because alone is sad)*

- **Mijote** - Participation in the development of an anime/manga-based language SaaS *(project in progress, and yes, it's weeb)*

*Sometimes code compiles on the first try, sometimes not. That's what makes the job interesting. And sometimes, you debug for 3 hours to find that a semicolon was missing.*
